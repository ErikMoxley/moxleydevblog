      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, my name is Erik and I currently live in the Greater Boston Area. Born in Gloucester, MA
          near the capes, some of my hobbies and passions include technology,
          building and fixing PCs, gaming, fantasy sports, dining out, and
          watching movies in theaters.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a strong sense of curiosity of how things work, a drive to
          succeed at whatever is placed in front of me and a work ethic that
          compliments all of the above. Computers have always been a passion of
          mine and in software development, I truly believe can be the gateway
          towards expressing my passions and creativity. My back has always been
          against the wall my entire life, and the desire to problem solve, help
          people and show everyone that caring is my greatest strength will be all
          of the motivation I will have along the way.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My resume is filled with years of management and leadership experience
          in a Pharmacy and Retail setting. Current languages, tools and
          technologies I use are HTML5, CSS3, Sass, Javascript, Bootstrap,
          ReactJS, Gatsby, NextJS, Git, GitHub, Command Line
          with some exposure to Jquery, NodeJS, MongoDB, some backend development.
          I currently deploy my web projects with GH-Pages and Netlify. My next
          steps are to explore uses of different API&apos;s and become well rounded in
          full-stack development in the near future.</p>
